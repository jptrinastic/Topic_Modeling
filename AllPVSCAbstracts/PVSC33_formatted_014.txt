Abstract: Inversion p-n ITO-nSi heterojunctions are the most promising low-cost solar cells using mono-crystalline silicon in comparison with ITO-nSi solar cells operating as Schottky diodes. It is shown that ITO-nSi inversion solar cells fabricated on 10 â„¦-cm silicon substrates present a conversion efficiency of 10.8 and 12.1% under AM0 and AM1.5 illumination conditions, respectively. Using actual experimental parameters, our theoretical analysis predicts an improved conversion efficiency up to 15% that can be achieved practically using low resistivity silicon substrates.
