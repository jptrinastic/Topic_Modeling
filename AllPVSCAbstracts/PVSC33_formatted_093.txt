Abstract: Passivation is the one of important factors in the solar cells. The measurement of effectiveness of the passivation layer was based on quasi-steady-state photoconductance. In the case of the sample which was passivated using p-type amorphous silicon(a-Si:H), the minority carrier lifetime was 8.9μs. When the passivation layer was intrinsic a-Si:H, the minority carrier lifetime was 221.3μs. Considering the minority carrier lifetimes of both samples, silicon heterojunction solar cells were fabricated with and without intrinsic a-Si:H layer. the efficiency of the sample passivated with intrinsic amorphous silicon was 13.52%, whereas it was only 11.58% when this layer was not employed.
