Abstract: This paper discusses the developments in thin-film PV technologies. It provides an outlook on future commercial module efficiencies achievable based on today's knowledge about champion cell performance. It also provides a relative cost comparison of thin-film and wafer/ribbon based Si PV modules. In 2007, about 65% of the modules produced in the US were thin-film modules when amorphous silicon modules are also considered.
