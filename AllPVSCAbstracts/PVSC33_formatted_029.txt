Abstract: Radial pn junctions are of interest in photovoltaics because of their potential to reduce the materials costs associated with cell fabrication. However, devices fabricated to date based on Au-catalyzed vapor-liquid-solid growth have suffered from low open-circuit voltages (to our knowledge the highest reports are 260 mV in the solid state and 389 mV in solid-liquid junctions). Herein we report on the potential of low-cost catalysts such as Cu and Ni to fabricate Si wire arrays with potentially higher minority-carrier lifetimes than is possible with a Au catalyst, as well as on the use of reactive ion etching to fabricate high-purity analogs to vapor-liquid-solid grown arrays.
