Abstract: Manufacturing technology is being developed for the mass-production III–V multijunction solar cells and receiver sub-assemblies to help enable the emerging concentrator PV industry. Production contracts of various sizes have allowed us to begin exercising this manufacturing technology, and significant momentum has been realized toward fulfilling large production contracts. Over 400,000 solar cells equivalent to 10 megaWatts under standard test conditions have been manufactured and tested. The manufacturing statistics for the large-area solar cells from this population are presented. Additionally, solar cells with areas ranging from 2 mm2 to 1 cm2 have been custom designed and manufactured for many different system integrators. These solar cells are used in a variety of different systems operating at concentration ratios between 400 and 1000 suns. An analysis of this test data examines how device area and concentration ratio affect both solar cell efficiency and power produced per wafer. Large solar cells are shown to be favorable over smaller solar cells from a power produced per wafer perspective. Finally, a receiver sub-assembly manufacturing line has been designed and installed. The first prototype receiver sub-assemblies capable of being manufactured in high volume have been produced and are described.
