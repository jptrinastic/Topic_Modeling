Abstract: We propose a principle of photovoltaics utilizing the built-in electric field generated by aligned nano-size dipoles in a semi-conductive host, either polymer or liquid, or amorphous, or polycrystalline. Such dipoles are readily found with the wurtzite CdS, CdSe and some other nanoparticles. We show that their generated field can be uniform and strong enough, âˆ¼ 30 kV/cm to separate electron-hole pairs and run significant drift currents. Our suggested structure is not based p-n or Schottky junctions and can be tunable in a broad range of parameters.
