Abstract: Low cost manufacturing of Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) films for high efficiency PV devices by the innovative Field-Assisted Simultaneous Synthesis and Transfer (FASST速) process is reported. The FASST速 process is a two-stage reactive transfer printing method relying on chemical reaction between two separate precursor films to form CIGS, one deposited on the substrate and the other on a printing plate in the first stage. In the second stage these precursors are brought into intimate contact and rapidly reacted under pressure in the presence of an applied electrostatic field. The method utilizes physical mechanisms characteristic of anodic wafer bonding and rapid thermal annealing, effectively creating a sealed micro-reactor that insures high material utilization efficiency, direct control of reaction pressure, and low thermal budget. The use of two independent precursors provides the benefits of independent composition and flexible deposition technique optimization, and eliminates pre-reaction prior to the second stage FASST速 synthesis of CIGS. High quality CIGS with large grains on the order of several microns are formed in just several minutes based on compositional and structural analysis by XRF, SIMS, SEM and XRD. Cell efficiencies of 12.2% have been achieved using this method.
