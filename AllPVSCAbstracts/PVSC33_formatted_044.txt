Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) simulation has been performed on the inverted metamorphic GaInP/GaAs/InGaAs triple-junction (TJ) solar cells based on the Crosslight APSYS with improved tunnel junction model. The APSYS simulator solves semiconductor drift-diffusion equations by finite-element method. Optic propagation in solar cell device is modeled with transfer matrix method and/or ray tracing. The carrier photo-generation is calculated using experimental absorption coefficients. SRH, Auger, radiative and surface/interface recombination are all taken into account. The 2D simulation gives detailed information on the band diagram, optical power absorption and carrier transport etc. The simulated results of one-sun Iâ€“V curve with Voc, Isc and efficiency are in good agreement with the experimental. The results are further discussed with respect to current matching, multi-sun concentration and the top contact grid spacing.
