Abstract: EQE measurements were performed on thin-film poly-Si solar cells fabricated by the solid phase crystallisation method of PECVD a-Si:H (PLASMA cells). PC1D simulation showed that a SiO2/aluminium rear reflector is superior to an aluminium reflector. A promising Jsc.EQE value of 23 mA/cm2 has been obtained for a 3 microns thick PLASMA poly-Si solar cell on Aluminium-Induced Texture (AIT) textured glass having a SiO2/aluminium rear reflector.
