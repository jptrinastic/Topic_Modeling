Abstract: One of the principal challenges that face the electrical generation stand-alone systems (EGSAS) in unsupervised installations classified as hazardous locations (Class I, Division 2) is to guarantee the permanent supply of the demanded electrical energy with a high degree of reliability. In the case of offshore satellite oil platforms (uninhabited), there exist critical electrical loads like measurement, control, communication, and process supervision devices. In this kind of application, especially when the strong power required onboard is less than 1KW, hybrid EGSAS which use photovoltaic (PV) modules as main generation source and a gas generator set as secondary source, is an adequate and mature technological choice to assume the above mentioned challenge. In this work it is described some of the advantages and disadvantages inherent to the application of the hybrid EGSAS in satellite offshore oil platforms (uninhabited), as a result of the evaluation carried out to a group of systems installed at the Zone of Campeche in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM). As well, a brief description of the main components which are parts of the balance of system is done; underlying the importance of an adequate system sizing in order to maximize the operative availability of the EGSAS, as such as, increase its reliability as electrical supply with minimal maintenance.
