Abstract: This paper reviews outdoor performance measurements conducted on FLATCON速 modules and systems. It highlights the influence of spectra, humidity, temperature, and acceptance angle on the module performance. The variation in efficiency due to spectral changes on a clear day was in the range of 5 % (relative). The influence of humidity could not be quantified easily because the underlying effect of the air mass change could not be separated. For our FLATCON速 modules we find an increase of operating cell temperature of 4 K per 100 W/m2 increase in DNI. FLATCON速 system performance has been also analysed. AC system efficiencies above 23 % have been measured for a 5.75 kW CPV system manufactured by Concentrix Solar.
