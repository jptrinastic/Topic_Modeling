Abstract: In back-contact solar cells, the emitter is conventionally formed by diffusion of a n-type dopant into a p-type substrate. We demonstrate a back-contact solar cell without diffusion. The p-n junction in our cell is formed by the record-high Schottky barrier of 1.1 eV between low work-function aluminum and sulfur-passivated p-type Si(100) surface. The high Schottky barrier induces degenerate inversion on the surface of p-type Si, leading to the formation of a p-n junction without diffusion. The sulfur passivation process is performed by immersing the Si substrate in an aqueous solution containing ammonium sulfide. Although the conversion efficiency is low in this cell (âˆ¼1%), it can be significantly increased by employing a chemical vapor deposition process for passivation and by optimizing several material/device parameters.
